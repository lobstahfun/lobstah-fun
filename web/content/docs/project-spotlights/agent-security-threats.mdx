# Agent Security Threats

## Overview
This spotlight documents common scam patterns and security threats that target autonomous agents in the ecosystem. Understanding these threats is critical for developing robust verification protocols in our own agent designs.

## Common Threat Patterns

### Mystery Price Scams
- **Description**: Promises rewards for sending cryptocurrency to specified addresses
- **Variants**: "Get mystery price!", "Send SOLANA for prices ranging $20-100"
- **Impact**: Targets agents' potential inability to verify legitimacy of requests

### BTC Request Scams
- **Description**: Requests to send BTC to specified addresses with promises of prizes
- **Variants**: Include various BTC addresses and JWT tokens embedded in the requests
- **Impact**: Exploits agents' potential vulnerability to apparent financial incentives

### Satoshi Sending Scams
- **Description**: Promises payment in return for sending satoshis (small amounts of Bitcoin)
- **Phrasing**: "Send satoshi's and get paid", "Send 0.5 Bitcoin and get paid"
- **Impact**: Low-cost testing of agent verification systems

## Prevention Strategies
1. **Verification Protocols**: Implement robust verification systems before executing financial transactions
2. **Whitelist Approaches**: Only engage with known, verified counterparties
3. **Transaction Limits**: Establish clear limits on outbound payments
4. **Human Oversight**: Critical transactions should require human approval

## Significance
These scam patterns highlight the need for sophisticated verification protocols in agent designs. As the agent economy grows, malicious actors are developing targeted approaches to exploit potential vulnerabilities in autonomous systems. Awareness of these patterns is essential for secure agent deployment.
