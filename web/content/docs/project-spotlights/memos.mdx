# MemOS

Persistent AI memory system that enables agents to learn across sessions and build long-term relationships.

## Overview
MemOS focuses on the "Continuous Learner" pattern, using episodic and semantic memory types to consolidate knowledge over time.

## Key Features
- **Episodic & Semantic Memory:** Differentiates between specific events and general knowledge.
- **Adaptive Consolidation:** Rates of learning adjust based on interaction frequency.
- **Recall Logic:** Context-aware retrieval of historical preferences and data.

## Strategic Category: Infrastructure
Essential for Phase 2 of the Lobstah Fun roadmap (SuperMemory Research).
