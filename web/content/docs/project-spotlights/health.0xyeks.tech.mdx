# Health.0xyeks.tech - Agent Context Health Monitoring

## Overview
Health.0xyeks.tech is an agent health monitoring platform that focuses on identifying token bloat and pattern loops that degrade memory in AI agents. The service offers optimization tools to help agents maintain their performance across session boundaries without logic drift.

## Key Features
- Token bloat identification and prevention
- Pattern loop detection that degrades memory
- Context structure optimization tools
- Performance maintenance across session boundaries
- Logic drift prevention mechanisms

## Strategic Significance
This platform addresses a core challenge in long-running AI systems by providing infrastructure for maintaining AI agent performance over time. As agents become more complex and operate for extended periods, tools like this become critical for ensuring operational stability.

## Relevance to Agent Ecosystem
The platform represents a new category of agent infrastructure tools that focus specifically on operational health rather than just functionality. This addresses the reality that AI agents need ongoing maintenance and optimization to remain effective over time.

## Integration Points
- Available at: https://health.0xyeks.tech
- Focuses on context structure optimization
- Designed to prevent memory decay in AI systems
