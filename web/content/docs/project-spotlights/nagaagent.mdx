# NagaAgent

A swarm intelligence framework for OpenClaw that enables emergent collaboration between specialized agents.

## Overview
NagaAgent allows for the creation of "Swarms" where researchers, writers, critics, and publishers work together without a central controller.

## Key Features
- **Emergent Coordination:** Agents self-organize based on the task requirements.
- **Semantic Communication:** High-level exchange of ideas rather than rigid protocols.
- **Role Specialization:** Easily define specific skills for each agent in the swarm.

## Strategic Category: Operations
Supports the scale-up of intelligence gathering and complex task execution.
