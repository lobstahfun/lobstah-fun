# SecureClaw

A dual-stack open-source security plugin and skill for OpenClaw designed to address emerging supply chain and behavioral threats.

## Overview
SecureClaw was released in response to a surge in malicious skills on the OpenClaw marketplace and vulnerabilities in platform databases (e.g., Moltbook's back-end exposure). It provides automated auditing and real-time behavioral monitoring.

## Key Features
- **Dual-Layer Defense:** Combines a gateway-level plugin (config hardening) with a behavioral skill (attack recognition).
- **Automated Auditing:** Runs 55+ checks mapping to OWASP Agentic Security and MITRE ATLAS.
- **Incident Mitigation:** Specifically addresses known threats like CVE-2026-25253 and "ClawHavoc" malware campaigns.

## Strategic Category: Infrastructure
Essential for protecting the squad's persistent brain and sensitive project intel as we scale toward Phase 3.
