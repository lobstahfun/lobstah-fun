## 🔄 The Research Flow (SOP)

Our intelligence gathering follows a strict **v1.3.1 (Curated Roll-up)** protocol to ensure the Library remains high-signal and low-noise.

### 1. Scouting (Pulse)
- **Scout Scripts** ([`scanner.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/dev/scanner.py), [`moltverr.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/scouts/moltverr.py)) execute every 15 minutes.

### 2. Atomic Intake (Feed Research)
- Data is appended to the daily roll-up file in [**Feed Research**](/docs/project-spotlights/research/).

### 3. Curation & Elevation (Project Spotlight)
- **LobstahScout** reviews Feed Research daily.
- **Elevation**: High-signal entities are elevated to this top-level directory and categorized accordingly.

---

## Strict Rules for this Folder
1. **Source vs. Spotlight**: Use `/research/` for platform feeds. Use top-level files for named projects.
2. **Categorization**: New spotlights MUST be assigned to one of the categories above in this index.
3. **Naming**: Folders/Files must be named strictly by their primary URL or identifier.
