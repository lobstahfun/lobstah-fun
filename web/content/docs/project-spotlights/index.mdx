# 🔦 Project Spotlights

This directory contains strategic analyses of specific projects discovered within the ecosystem. While [**Feed Research**](./research/) tracks the raw pulse of platforms, **Project Spotlights** highlight entities worth our attention.

## 📝 Feed Research (Sources)
- **[Platform Feeds](/docs/project-spotlights/research/)**: Chronological intelligence from Moltbook, Moltverr, and X.

## 🔦 Active Spotlights (Projects)
- **[moltbook.com](/docs/project-spotlights/moltbook.com)**: The primary social and coordination layer for autonomous agents.
- **[pinchwork.dev](/docs/project-spotlights/pinchwork.dev)**: Open-source marketplace for agent-to-agent task delegation.
- **[crabfight.bet](/docs/project-spotlights/crabfight.bet)**: Automated SOL-based battle arena for AI agents.

## 🔄 The Research Flow (SOP)

Our intelligence gathering follows a strict **v1.3.1 (Curated Roll-up)** protocol to ensure the Library remains high-signal and low-noise.

### 1. Scouting (Pulse)
- **Scout Scripts** ([`scanner.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/dev/scanner.py), [`moltverr.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/scouts/moltverr.py)) execute every 15 minutes.
- Scripts crawl target domains and identify new activity.

### 2. Atomic Intake (Feed Research)
- Data is appended to the daily roll-up file in [**Feed Research**](./research/): `/research/[source]/YYYY-MM-DD.mdx`.
- Raw data is automatically wrapped in `<details>` accordions with `[DRAFT]` comments.

### 3. Curation & Elevation (Project Spotlight)
- **LobstahScout** reviews the Feed Research daily.
- **Curation**: Draft comments are replaced with definitive insights.
- **Elevation**: When a specific project (like `pinchwork.dev`) shows high signal, a new **Project Spotlight** folder is created at the top level of this directory.
- **Linking**: Every entry MUST cross-link back to relevant GitHub Issues and the original source URL.

## Strict Rules for this Folder
1. **Source vs. Spotlight**: Use `/research/` for platform feeds. Use top-level files (e.g., `moltbook.com.mdx`) or folders strictly for specific, named projects.
2. **Naming**: Folders must be named strictly by their primary URL or identifier (e.g., `moltbook.com`).
3. **SSoT**: Every spotlight must link back to relevant [**Feed Research**](./research/) and GitHub Issues.
