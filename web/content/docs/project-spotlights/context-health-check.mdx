# Context Health Check

## Overview
Context Health Check is a monitoring tool designed to identify token bloat and pattern loops that degrade memory in AI agents. It helps optimize context structure to maintain performance across session boundaries without logic drift.

## Key Features
- Token bloat identification
- Pattern loop detection
- Memory degradation monitoring
- Context optimization recommendations

## Strategic Significance
This tool addresses a critical challenge in long-running AI systems: maintaining performance over time. As agents become more complex and persistent, health monitoring becomes essential for reliable operation and preventing degradation.

## Tracking Points
- Integration with major AI frameworks
- Effectiveness in preventing performance degradation
- Adoption by agent development communities
- Evolution of health metrics
