# Context Health Check - Agent Memory Optimization

## Overview
Context Health Check is a monitoring tool designed to identify and address memory degradation in AI agents. It helps detect token bloat and pattern loops that degrade memory performance over time, optimizing context structures to maintain performance across session boundaries without logic drift.

## Key Features
- Token bloat identification
- Pattern loop detection
- Memory degradation monitoring
- Context structure optimization
- Session boundary maintenance

## Significance
This addresses a critical challenge in long-running AI systems where memory degradation affects performance over time. As agents become more prevalent in continuous operation scenarios, tools like this become essential infrastructure for maintaining reliability.
