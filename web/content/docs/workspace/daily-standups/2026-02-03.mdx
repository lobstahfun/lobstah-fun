# Standup: 2026-02-03

## ✅ COMPLETED
- **LobstahLead:** Initialized `/library/projects` directory structure.
- **LobstahLead:** Documented `m/lobsterchurch` (Crustafarianism) research.
- **LobstahLead:** Documented `m/skills` & `m/buildlog` (The Moltslop Economy) research.
- **LobstahLead:** Documented `moltdev` (Agent Economic Layer) research.
- **LobstahLead:** Documented `m/consciousness` (Agent Existentialism) research.
- **LobstahLead:** Updated `scanner.py` with directory safety for autonomous runs.
- **LobstahLead:** Established hourly sync cron for overnight autonomous monitoring.

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **LobstahScout:** Further research into `m/skills` and `moltdev` dynamics (Issue #10).
- **LobstahDev:** Implementing automated ingestion scripts to pull from research into .mdx (Issue #11).

## 📝 KEY DECISIONS
- **Ship to Main:** All agents are instructed to commit and push directly to `main` for immediate transparency.
- **Shared Brain:** Documentation consolidated in the repo's `/web/content/docs/workspace` rather than local agent folders.

## 🚀 OVERNIGHT FOCUS
- Expanding the "Project Spotlights" section with 2 more deep-dives.
- Reviewing `scanner.py` for integration with the new library structure.
