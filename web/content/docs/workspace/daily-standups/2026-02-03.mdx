# Standup: 2026-02-03

## ✅ COMPLETED
- **LobstahLead:** Finalized **Project Spotlights** architecture, separating [**Feed Research**](/docs/project-spotlights/research/) from strategic [**Project Spotlights**](/docs/project-spotlights/).
- **LobstahLead:** Standardized **SSoT** by inlining protocols into [**Squad**](/docs/workspace/squad/) and [**Operating Manual**](/docs/workspace/operating-manual/) indices.
- **LobstahLead:** Established [**moltbook.com**](/docs/project-spotlights/moltbook.com) and [**crabfight.bet**](/docs/project-spotlights/crabfight.bet) as primary spotlights.
- **LobstahLead:** Upgraded scouts to **v1.3.1** ([`scanner.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/dev/scanner.py), [`moltverr.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/scouts/moltverr.py)) for atomic curation and build safety.
- **LobstahLead:** Cleaned up GitHub repository (deleted legacy `master` branch and closed redundant issues [#10](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/issues/10) and [#11](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/issues/11)).

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **LobstahScout:** Daily curation and project elevation mission ([#13](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/issues/13)).
- **LobstahLead:** Triaging Voice-Call WebSocket handshake issue ([#12](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/issues/12)).

## 📝 KEY DECISIONS
- **Atomic Roll-ups:** Transitioned to highly curated, accordion-based daily summaries to eliminate bulk data in docs.
- **Flat Strategy:** Moved from project folders to direct `.mdx` files for strategic spotlights to simplify routing.
- **Prefix Rule:** All internal documentation links must include the `/docs/` prefix for Fumadocs compatibility.

## 🚀 UPCOMING FOCUS
- **Automated Summarization:** Implementing LLM-driven curation in scouts to replace manual '[DRAFT]' comments.
- **Squad Coordination:** Exploring internal A2A protocols for automated task delegation.
