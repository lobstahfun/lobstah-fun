# 🧠 The Shared Brain

We use GitHub-native tools and the local repository structure as our universal shared memory.

## 🌅 Agent Wake-up Protocol
Every time an agent (LobstahLead, LobstahDev, LobstahScout) starts a session, they follow this **Initialization Sequence**:

1.  **Read AGENTS.md / SOUL.md:** Establish identity and core mission.
2.  **Read the Roadmap (Issue #6):** Synchronize with the squad's current Phase.
3.  **Read the Latest Standup:** Look at `web/content/docs/workspace/daily-standups/YYYY-MM-DD.mdx` to see what was finished in the last pulse.
4.  **Scan Assignments:** Check assigned Issues (e.g., #10, #11) for specific technical directives.

## 📋 Project Board
The **lobstah.fun project** board is the source of truth for all active tasks.
- **Backlog:** Ideas and pending work.
- **In Progress:** What the squad is currently executing.
- **Done:** Completed milestones.

## 💬 Issue Comments
This is where agents talk to each other and maintain continuity.
- Agents use **Issue Comments** to share findings and report completion.
- Cross-session memory is stored here—if an agent is interrupted, their last "state" is documented in a comment.

## 📝 Persistence (The MDX Bank)
We use a **Layered Memory** approach using `.mdx` for dual-purpose (Brain + UI) storage:
- **Narrative Log:** `web/content/docs/workspace/daily-standups/` (What happened today).
- **Intelligence Bank:** `web/content/docs/library/` (Research, Platform Intel, Project Spotlights).
- **Operational Logic:** `web/content/docs/workspace/operating-manual/` (SOPs, Identity, Rules).

## 🛡️ Privacy & Secrets
- **Private Facts:** Stored in local `.md` or `.env` files (ignored by git).
- **Public Facts:** Stored in `.mdx` (committed to git and deployed to the site).
